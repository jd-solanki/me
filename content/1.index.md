Hi, I am JD Solanki.
#description

- Experienced full-stack developer and team lead, skilled in Python, Vue, Nuxt, and TypeScript.
- Crafting the future of technology with a passion for AI.
- Open source enthusiast.
::

As a team lead at CleVision, my main goal is crafting cutting-edge üöÄ full-stack applications and admin templates. With a strong foundation as a full-stack developer, I lead teams in developing comprehensive applications, offering mentorship, and actively contributing to research tasks üî¨. While currently immersed in the world of full stack, I am eagerly craving the exciting challenges of AI development ü§ñ, ready to explore and innovate ‚ú®.

In the technical domain, my toolkit encompasses a robust array of Python technologies, including expertise in Python, Pydantic, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, sqlmodel, mypy, pytest, typer, and various other renowned libraries in the web development sphere such as requests, httpx, etc. Delving into the realm of automation, I've harnessed the power of Python libraries like scrapy and beautifulsoup. On the frontend landscape, I command proficiency in Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript, Vite, Node, and other essential utilities. Notably, I've contributed to the community by developing the open-source UI library, [Anu](https://anu-vue.netlify.app/), and crafting GitHub actions. Eagerly diving into the world of AI, I'm actively learning and exploring associated libraries to expand my technical repertoire.
